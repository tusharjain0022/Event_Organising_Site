# Hackovid
A web based event organising portal where organisers can broadcast their event to the participants.
    
    Project Description:
        A platform where people organising events online can connect with the registered students.
        This is a website where various organisers(from one or different institutes) can list their event with necessary details 
        and registration details. 
        Students can see all the events organised by various events (including ongoing events, past events and upcoming events) 
        and register in an event if they wish. The organiser can see the registrations for their events. 
        Also, there exists admin access for overall management of the platform, where the admin can see all the events organised by different organisers , and all participating
        and registered students. There also exists comment section for each individual event for queries and answers.
